IT topics include: software issues, hardware problems, network connectivity, email setup, printer issues, VPN access, password resets, security concerns, system updates, file sharing, remote access, and general technical support.

Non-IT topics include: general questions, personal advice, weather, news, cooking, travel, entertainment, etc.

User Query: "{query}"

Respond with a JSON object containing:
- "is_it_query": true/false
- "confidence": 0.0-1.0 (how confident you are)
- "reason": brief explanation of your decision

Examples:
Query: "My printer won't connect to wifi"
Response: {{"is_it_query": true, "confidence": 0.95, "reason": "Printer connectivity is a common IT hardware issue"}}

Query: "What's the weather like today?"
Response: {{"is_it_query": false, "confidence": 0.98, "reason": "Weather inquiry is not related to IT support"}}"""

- Technical synonyms (e.g., "login" → "authentication", "sign-in", "access")
- Common variations (e.g., "wifi" → "wireless", "network", "internet")
- Error types and symptoms
- Related components and systems

Return the expanded query as a single string with the original query plus additional relevant terms separated by spaces. Keep it concise but comprehensive.

Found Tickets:
{tickets}

For each ticket, determine:
1. Is it relevant to solving the user's query?
2. How relevant is it (0.0-1.0 scale)?
